An accountant with a strong analytical background and attention to detail gone rogue in the name of the Web.

After graduating from Bentley University in Massachusetts with a degree in Corporate Finance & Accounting, I spent two years working in risk consulting and audit in NYC and London as an Intellectual Property and Contract Governance Advisor for large technology companies.

While I have always had an affection for numbers and logical thinking, I came to the realisation that I need some creativity in my life and that's when I fell in love with coding.

I would love to work as a web or software developer for a purpose-driven company that strives to be better than yesterday and understands the importance of education, mentorship and personal growth.

* Made the decision to switch careers in November and become a web developer (1500 hours of coding and counting).
