An accountant with a strong analytical background and attention to detail gone rogue in the name of the Web.

After graduating summa cum laude from Bentley University in Massachusetts with a degree in Corporate Finance & Accounting, I spent two years working in risk consulting and audit in NYC and London as an Intellectual Property and Contract Governance Advisor for large technology companies.

While I have always had an affection for numbers and logical thinking, I came to the realisation that I need some creativity in my life and that's when I fell in love with coding.

I would love to work as a web or software developer for a purpose-driven company that strives to be better than yesterday and understands the importance of education, mentorship and personal growth.

## <a name='skills'> Skills </a>

#### Independent and Fast Learner

* Self taught myself coding for four months and built a website prior to attending Makers Academy.
* Learned how to develop an Alexa skill in 2 days and lead the final project.
* Built an Alexa Voice Service prototype in 2 hours using Raspberry Pi to test my Alexa skills.
* Created a multiplayer game with my team in 4 days without any previous experience in web sockets.

#### Grit, Adaptability & Emotional Intelligence

* Began my university journey with relatively minimal English skills and graduated in the top 20 of my class.
* Got a highly competitive internship in New York during my junior year, which translated into a full time job after graduation.
* Outperformed during my first year at KPMG, and was offered to relocate to London when I was not selected in the visa lottery.
* Made the decision to switch careers in November and become a web developer (1500 hours of coding and counting).

None of these achievements would have happened if it wasn't for my discipline and perseverance (grit), ability to accept change (adaptability), and motivation and self-awareness (EI).
